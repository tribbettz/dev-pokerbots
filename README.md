##Python Poker Engine##

This is the early development of a python poker engine and pluggable bots. The purpose of this development is get familiar with these systems and theories for the 2013 MIT Pokerbot competition. 

Perhaps after the competition we will turn this into a tutorial for programming in python, ai, game theory, etc. 

Dream Big. Think Limitlessly. Do Fearlessly.
